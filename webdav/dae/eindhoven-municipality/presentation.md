# Municipality Project

Dataset is not public. We are going to sign a NDA. It's possible not to accept this project.
Phase 1: Investigate data and concept by Toon.
Phase 2: Prepare the show.

## Rehearsing the future of Urban Developments, Infrastructure and Mobility

Design Research
Design challenges
New representations of spaces and flows
Identities of people
Innovative design research concepts and methods

## Dealing with Uncertainty

### Deep uncertainty

- Epistemic uncertainty (Lack of data, inadequate models, unknown correlations / interactions) => Why they did a qualitative study
- Variability uncertainty and value diversity => Look of the normative aspects, values, political
- Ontological unpredictability 

### Scenario as a tool

What could you do to act in the future. "We are a democratic country blablabla, we only advice."
Field of speculation, design fiction, speculative design.

Two axes: Complexity vs Uncertainty (Low to High)
(0,0) => PROGNOSES
(1,1) => Scenarios
(2,2) => Speculations

PBL, 2013

### Method

- Distinctive, they should be very different, no overlap
- Provocative
- Consistent

Two mains variables (economics, demography) => 4 quadrants
Here they are mixing 11 dimensions

- Governance (Eu, National, Region/city, Market, Civic Society)
- Sustainability (People, Planet, Profit)
- Society and technology (Society, Culture, Technology)

He oppose caring with efficiency, and relates efficiency with haste

From societal values to urban and infrastructure futures

THey uses anthropology to propose settings, all different and "acceptable", "not too wild for people".

### Four scenarios

- Bubble city (Ex. High Tech world where high tech does not function already)
- State of Green
- Market Place
- Our Neighborhood

They don't really take into account the climate changes consequences (?) and pact.

#### Bubble city

Not big audiences
- Fragmented society
- Market and lifestyle collectives in the ldead
- Small role for government
- Digital more important than physical
- Robots and humans mingle
- Technology buggy and brittle

##### Urban structure

- Few changes in urban pattern
- Geo becomes less important
- Former centers less relevant
- Less connection with places (physical)
- New dynamics in outdates real estate
- Temporary programming with virtual and augmented reality

Ex question: What would be a school in that scenario ? All with Hololenses ? What does than mean for the urban structure.

##### Infrastructure and transport

- Fewer physical movement
- Mobility as a service is important
- Self driving cars but poor communication out of sync
- High level of accessibility as a long as you have digital skills
- Mediocre maintenance of interurban and international infrastructure

#### State of Green

- Top down green system transition
- People considered part of ecosystem
- Planet points
- Not having is the norm
- Technology serves green ambitions (it is not a low tech scenario)
- Better living environment, less freedom of choice

##### Infrastructure and transport

- Optimal use of existing urban structure, mixed functions/small centers
- Proximity
- Transit oriented development: concentration of urban developments around transport nodes
- Sharing of homes
- Outside of urban area: low level of facilities (self-sufficiency; off-grid)
- Minimizing the need for travel
- Walking and cycling are the norm followed by public transport
- Shift of investments from road to public transport 'local and regional light rail
- Self driving cars are used only for collective transport

#### Market Place

Performance, success and self-reliance
Speed
Government facilities business
Technology serves efficiency
Sharp increase in the use of robots
Having is important

##### Urban structure

Market driven urbanization
Strong centers
Other neighborhood/districts are lagging behind, strongly
Contrast between booming regions and peripheral regions (CoreNL: work/WeekendNL: relax)
High level of personal services at home (if one can afford)

##### Infrastructure and transport

Lots of mobility all possible modes of transport
Walking and cycling on prosperous campus areas
Public transport is for those who cannot afford proximity
Self driving cars on a large scale with exclusive infrastructure (privatized, priced roads)
Big differences in accessibility

#### Our Neighborhood

Own Neighborhood is the center of daily life
People considered part of a social group (community, rootedness)
Enjoying life and caring is important
Sharing is mort important than having
Local and regional differences
Supra-local coordination is difficult
Pleasant environment (as long as you are part of the local community)

Disadvantage (?): "Anything big will have hard-time being done."

##### Urban structure

- Small scale is important
- Mixed functions
- Neighborhood and regions cultivate their own character
- Varied pattern of medium-sized cities, suburbs and villages
- Multi generational homes
- Maker spaces (local production)

##### Infrastructure and transport

Preference for small action radius and active mobility (cycling, walking)
Quality of thee living environment more important than traveling far or fast
Autonomous transport slow and not very popular
Local/regional Neighborhood buses with driver
Local/regional infrastructures well-maintained; national and international infrastructures neglected

Disadvantage: Planning and designing finance are different, its not national, Eindhoven don't pay for Rotterdam plans.

## Using the scenarios in policy practice (Workshop tour)

It's the image of the future that shape present decisions - Jens Beckert

### How the scenarios can be used in policy

- Increase insight and awareness
- Support communication about uncertainty
- Strengthen involvement

### Three types of questions can be answered

- What can urban regions and infrastructures look life in different futures
- Do the scenarios shed a new light on current policy issues and choices that have to be made in the short term ?
- Which new issues and policy options do the scenarios bring into view ?

## To what extent you can be personal in research

Convince your audience, what do you have to offer, SHOW WHY DO THAT, transparency. Psychology, cultural, whatever, you have something to offer people, then YES, that's interesting.

Still, be clear, in the method that you use. My personal history doesn't matter in this kind of research? You do it for an audience.
