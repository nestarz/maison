# Parasite

Is this city lost ? Lost in time, lost in place ? Why everything seems dark yet bohemian, empty yet life centered ? Where am I, who am I, maybe this city can be the vessel of my self for a moment. A step back from the reality to synthesize my dreams. It's nothing like I ever known. Nor this is holidays, or my daily life, it's more a spirit experience to feel if I belong here or I am a parasite.

## A poetic translation between homes

What feels better than being home after a long journey ? Let's think the return before the voyage. It's about habits, known space, references, it's about roots, molds, rebellions, stories of loves and loss.

Our storage is our body memory. It's a self construct memory that can never be a true reflection of reality on his own, but it's a true story of it. And this city, empty but reminiscent, will be a support of the projection of our story.
